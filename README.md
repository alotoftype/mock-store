### _Api_

### Vue

I was unable to find a free react component library. I feel between this one that I am sharing [here](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/templates/ecommerce/) and the storefront ui component library you should be able to tackle the plp and the pdp pages. If you have your own library yourself then feel free to use that as well.

### _Colors_
